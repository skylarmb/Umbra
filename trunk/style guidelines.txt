Naming:
    Names should be descriptive. Do not use abreviations.
    For functions and local variables use only lower case letters. Use a _ to separate words.
    "Classes" should begin with an upper case letter and be written in CamelCase.
    Do not use magic numbers, define constants and mark them with a k before their name. Use CamelCase for constants.
    Keep files organized in folders based off file type (script folder, css folder, images folder, etc.)
    Keep filenames all lowercase. Use a _ to separate words.
    
Comments:
    Keep your comment style consistant.
	Don't mix comments and code.
    Place a comment before each function with a short description of what it does. State preconditions, postconditions, input, and output.
		Example: // multiply: multiplies the multiplicand and multiplier and then returns the result.
				 function multiply(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    Comment before any hard to follow code. You don't need to comment everything but if you think it might be hard to follow comment it.
    Add comments with the TODO(name) flag to mark future changes.
        Example: // TODO(aj): Invert if statements to reduce nesting

General Style:
    Try to keep lines shorter than 80 characters.
    Only use ASCII characters, UTF-8 should only be used if it is 100% nesisary.
    Indentation: use 2 spaces per indentation. (Discuss if we want to use tabs instead?)
    Keep function declarations on one line, if parameter lists become too long keep the parameters alligned.
        Example: function name(paramter1, parameter2,
                               parameter3, parameter4) {
    Never put a space between the function name and an opening (. Also don't put a space after the (.
    Don't put a space before the final ). Do put a space and then a { after it.
    Function calls follow similar guidelines. 
        Example var result = name(argument1, argument2,
                                  argument3, argument4);
    For control flow elements (if, while, for) place a space before the (. Do not put spaces after the ( or before the ).
    Do not place if statements and it's following expresion on one line if there's an else statement.
    If there's braces on one part of an if, else if, else (or any combination of) group you must use { and } for each branch.
        Example: if (foo == bar) {
                    // Do something
                 }
                 else if (foo == baz) {
                    // Do something else
                 }
                 else {
                    // Final possibility
                 }
    Don't add needless ()'s to return statements.
	Don't add needless whitespace. Newlines can be added for clarity but use it conservatively.

If you have any doubts ask A.J. first.
Remember, keep your code consistant. It is very hard to follow inconsistent code.
